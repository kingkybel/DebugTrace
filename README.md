# DebugTrace

Simple debug tracing for convenience

# Installation

The installation and build is tested on *ubuntu24.04 LTS*

## dependencies

## use cmake to install the header-only library

```bash
# change the next line to change the install prefix to your liking
INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
mkdir ./build
cd build
cmake -Wno-dev -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_PREFIX} ..
cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
sudo cmake --install .
```
This will install the headers from the include-folder to `${INSTALL_PREFIX}/dkyb`

To use the headers in your code, make sure that ${INSTALL_PREFIX} is in the include directories of your project.
Include the file in your code e.g:
```c++
#define DO_TRACE_
#include <dkyb/traceutil.h>
```
